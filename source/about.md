Welcome to what I assume to be my personal site.  I'll likely post things about personal projects or things I find interesting.

My day job (as of January 2017) involves copious amounts of Ruby (on Rails!) and CoffeeScript, but I can make sense of just about any language you put in front of me.
I've done work with Python, JS, and Java.

I've gotten as far as downloading Elm and Elixir, so that counts as knowing functional programming, right? Mapping and reducing and all that jazz.

I make no promises on updating this About page regularly.
